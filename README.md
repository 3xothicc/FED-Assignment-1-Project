Hotel Elie's Website

My project is about the creation of a website for a fictional hotel, Hotel Elie. This hotel building was modelled by me previously in another software. The building itself is meant to be a 1920s era building, running in the present day as a hotel.

The website is a mock-up of what a commercial website created for the hotel group would look like, for use in booking, sales and promotions.



Design Process
As the hotel is based around 1920s-30s architecture, I decided to go with an art-deco/art-nouveau theming, with a brown background with gold accents. I took reference from similarly themed companies and posters for this.

The website should allow the hotel to provide customers with a smooth user experience, to encourage people to book a stay at the hotel through their site.

As a potential customer for the hotel, I would like to be able to know a brief history of the hotel, what it offers, and book a stay for it. Through use of forms and images, the user should be able to book a stay through the website, potentially key in any promo codes they have for vouchers, and understand what amenities and rooms the hotel offers.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
